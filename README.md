Repository for a prototype testing the abilities of large language models to punctuate Norwegian sentences, with a particular emphasis on comma placement. The repository includes the following files:

- [kommaregler.json](https://github.com/hans-chr-f/komma/blob/main/kommaregler.json): A dictionary of Norwegian comma rules, where keys are arbitrary integers and values are sentences describing each rule.
- [test.txt](https://github.com/hans-chr-f/komma/blob/main/test.txt): A list of sentences, each annotated with correct punctuation, followed by an integer that matches a key in the dictionary.
- train.txt
